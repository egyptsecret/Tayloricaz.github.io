All there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nSo, I sneak out to the garden to see you\nWe keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew\nSo, close your eyes\nEscape this town for a little while\nOh, oh\n\n'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet.\"\nBut you were everything to me\nI was begging you, \"Please don't go!\"\nAnd I said\n\n\"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\nI'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'\n\nRomeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel\nThis love is difficult but it's real\nDon't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nI got tired of waiting\nWondering if you were ever coming around\nMy faith in you was fading\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town\nAnd I said\n\n\"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone\nI keep waiting for you, but you never come\nIs this in my head? I don't know what to think.\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said\n\n\"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone\nI love you, and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

Will it patch your broken wings?\nI'm only seventeen\nI don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\nStanding in your cardigan\nKissing in my car again\nStopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you"

All there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'\n\nRomeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel\nThis love is difficult but it's real\nDon't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nI got tired of waiting\nWondering if you were ever coming around\nMy faith in you was fading\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town\nAnd I said\n\n\"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone\nI keep waiting for you, but you never come\nIs this in my head? I don't know what to think.\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said\n\n\"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone\nI love you, and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

Don't know why I do\n\nHe's the time taken up, but there's never enough\nAnd he's all that I need to fall into\n\nDrew looks at me\nI fake a smile so he won't see"

    "lyrics": "Clear blue water\nHigh tide came and brought you in\nAnd I could go on and on, on and on, and I will\nSkies grew darker\nCurrents swept you out again\nAnd you were just gone and gone, gone and gone\nIn silent screams\nIn wildest dreams\nI never dreamed of this\nThis love is good\nThis love is bad\nThis love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh\nThese hands had to let it go free, and\nThis love came back to me, oh, oh, oh\nOhh\nOh, oh, oh\nTossing, turning\nStruggled through the night with someone new\nAnd I could go on and on, on and on\nLantern, burning\nFlickered in the night, only you\nBut you were still gone, gone, gone\nIn losing grip\nOn sinking ships\nYou showed up just in time\nThis love is good\nThis love is bad\nThis love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh\nThese hands had to let it go free, and\nThis love came back to me, oh, oh, oh\nThis love left a permanent mark\nThis love is glowing in the dark, oh, oh, oh\nThese hands had to let it go free, and\nThis love came back to me, oh, oh, oh\nYour kiss, my cheek\nI watched you leave\nYour smile, my ghost\nI fell to my knees\nWhen you're young, you just run\nBut you come back to what you need\nThis love is good\nThis love is bad\nThis love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh\nThese hands had to let it go free, and\nThis love came back to me, oh, oh, oh\nThis love left a permanent mark\nThis love is glowing in the dark, oh, oh, oh\nThese hands had to let it go free, and\nThis love came back to me, oh, oh, oh\nThis love came back to me, oh, oh, oh"

    "lyrics": "You brush past me in the hallway\nAnd you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?\nI've been watchin' you for ages\nAnd I spend my time tryin' not to feel it\nBut what would you do if I went to touch you now?\nWhat would you do if they never found us out?\nWhat would you do if we never made a sound?\n'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me\nAnd I could see you up against the wall with me\nAnd what would you do, baby, if you only knew?\nThat I can see you\nAnd we kept everything professional\nBut something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like\nThey keep watchful eyes on us\nSo it's best that we move fast and keep quiet\nYou won't believe half the things I see inside my head\nWait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet\nBut what would you do if I went to touch you now?\nWhat would you do if they never found us out?\nWhat would you do if we never made a sound?\n'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me\nAnd I could see you up against the wall with me\nAnd what would you do, baby, if you only knew?\nThat I could see you throw your jacket on the floor\nI could see you make me want you even more\nWhat would you do, baby, if you only knew?\nThat I can see you\nI could see you in your suit and your necktie\nPassed me a note saying, \"Meet me tonight\"\nThen we kiss, and you know I won't ever tell, yeah\nAnd I could see you being my addiction\nYou can see me as a secret mission\nHide away and I will start behaving myself\nI can see you waitin' down the hall from me\nAnd I could see you up against the wall with me\nAnd what would you do, baby, if you only knew? Oh\nAnd I could see you throw your jacket on the floor\nI could see you make me want you even more\nWhat would you do, baby, if you only knew?\nThat I can see you, oh, I can see you\nOh, I see you, I see you, baby\nI see you\n(ah-ah, ah, ah) I see you, I see you, baby\nOh, baby"

    "lyrics": "Once, I had an empire in a golden age\nI was held up so high, I used to be great\nThey used to cheer when they saw my face\nNow, I fear I have fallen from grace\nAnd I feel like my castle's crumbling down\nAnd I watch all my bridges burn to the ground\nAnd you don't want to know me\nI will just let you down\nYou don't wanna know me now\nOnce, I was the great hope for a dynasty\nCrowds would hang on my words, and they trusted me\nTheir faith was strong, but I pushed it too far\nI held that grudge 'til it tore me apart\nPower went to my head, and I couldn't stop\nOnes I loved tried to help, so I ran them off\nAnd here I sit alone, behind walls of regret\nFalling down like promises that I never kept\nAnd I feel like my castle's crumbling down\nAnd I watch all my bridges burn to the ground\nAnd you don't want to know me\nI will just let you down\nYou don't wanna know me now (now)\nMy foes and friends watch my reign end\nI don't know how it could've ended this way\nSmoke billows from my ships in the harbor\nPeople look at me like I'm a monster\nNow they're screaming at the palace front gates, used to chant my name\nNow they're screaming that they hate me\nNever wanted you to hate me\nMy castle's crumbling down\nAnd I watch all my bridges burn to the ground\nAnd you don't want to know me\nI will just let you down (just let you down)\nMy castle's crumbling down\nYou don't wanna know me now"
